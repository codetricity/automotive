      provide digital customers with experiences that were once only \
      available in-store. Car Media 360 empowers shoppers to navigate \
      your inventory through an immersive user-led experience. By \
      combining high-resolution photography with video or detail \
      hotspots, consumers can experience the unique benefits associated \
      with your inventory. Including Car Media 360 Vehicle Merchandising \
      on your VDPs makes them more fun and engaging for digital \
      customers to interact with. By giving digital customers the \
      chance to see the vehicle inside and out with their own two eyes, \
      they get complete transparency into the state of the vehicle, \
      making them more likely to buy.",
