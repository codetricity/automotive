      "details": "Peter had troubles while trying to post 360 images to Google Maps. \
      His stated main use is for leisure (like walking or festivals) rather than business. \
      But THETA 360 images are not placed correctly, the blue dot on Google Maps does not \
      reflect the actual location. Also, the Google Street View app is going away and being \
      replaced with Google Street View Studio, but it only supports video, not individual images. So \
      he built a program that uses Google Places API to display points of interest near photo \
      locations. He uses Google Oauth2 API authenticate uploads, extracts location, time and \
      altitude data, and uses Googles StreetViewPublish API to upload the photos. Nice fix!",
